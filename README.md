### 🧭 Who Am I?

I'm a student on a relentless journey through the world of computers. Before even starting college, I've dived deep into:

- 🖥️ C Programming — mastering the core of how machines think
- 🌐 HTML & Web Development — building the web from scratch
- 🧠 Ethical Hacking — learning how to protect by understanding how to break
- 🐧 Linux (Kali) — living in the terminal, one command at a time

I’m building, breaking, and learning in public—with every push, commit, and repo.
